      'HTTP stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol and is the foundation for data transfer on the World Wide Web.',
      'It defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and how servers and browsers respond.',
      'When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to the server, which then returns the requested page.',
      'HTTP is stateless: each request is independent and the server does not remember previous requests.',
